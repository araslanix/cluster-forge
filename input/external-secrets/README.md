[External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) is used to populate secrets into cluster without directly applying secrets. The cluster store backend can be (for example) AWS Secrets, Google Secrets Manager, 1Password, Vault, etc. 
This default installation uses local kubernetes secrets as a backend to ensure applications are configured properly to use External Secrets. In non-demo/test use the backend must be switched to a production quality secure location.
