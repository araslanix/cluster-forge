# cluster-forge
Kuberentes operator which sets up all platform tools to have a cluster ready for applications to run.

## Useage
First, ensure you have [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) installed. Nothing will work out of the box, and it will be painful (yet possible) to do without. 

Then, execute 
```bash
devbox shell
```
inside your terminal in the directory of this project.

```bash
just demo
```
will get you started.
